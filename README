### 🔐 Security Overview

- **Groups** (hierarchical):
  - `Academy Student`
  - `Academy Instructor` (implies Student)
  - `Academy Manager` (implies Instructor)

- **Record rules (simplified):**
  - Students:
    - See only **published** courses  
    - See only their own enrollments  
  - Instructors:
    - See all courses and enrollments  
  - Managers:
    - Full access to all academy records  

Model-level access (CRUD) is defined in `security/ir.model.access.csv` and combined with record rules.

### ✅ Quick Testing Checklist

1. Create sample categories, courses, students, and instructors.  
2. Confirm enrollments until a course is full → last confirmation should raise an error.  
3. Try a second enrollment for the same student & course → SQL constraint error.  
4. Verify students see only **published** courses, while managers see all.  
5. Change grades/attendance and confirm `passed` updates as expected.  
6. Check that course code is auto-uppercased and cannot be duplicated.
